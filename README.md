Octopus

Simple to-do list command line tool
-----------------------------------

**octopus** is a simple to-do list command line tool inspired
by an example featured in the book [*Learn You a Haskell*](http://learnyouahaskell.com) by Miran Lipovaca. I am making it mainly for fun and to help
organize myself.
